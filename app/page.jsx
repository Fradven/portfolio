          As a junior developer at Prismatech and previously at Zeiko and AppiStadium, I have
          learned some essential skills of web development such as creating well
          documented repositories on github, the intricacies of Javascript
          framework like React or Vue.js and back-end management using SQL in
          PHP or Java. At BeCode, I was shown the importance of developing soft skills as I
          had to work in multiple group projects in small varied team and I
          had to present several Tech-Talk and Workshop in French as well as in
          English throughout the year I was there.
